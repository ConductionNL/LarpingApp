# Larping: A Comprehensive Management Tool for LARP Organizations

Welcome to **Larping**, your all-in-one solution for managing your live-action role-playing (LARP) events and characters. With Larping, you can streamline your event organization, character creation, and gameplay mechanics, all in one powerful tool. Perfect for LARP organizers, game masters, and players alike, Larping offers a flexible and intuitive platform to handle everything from character skills to in-game items and event subscriptions.

## üéÆ Key Features

### 1. **Character Management**
- **Create and Customize Characters**: Design unique characters with custom attributes, such as hit points, armor points, experience points (XP), mana, or any other ability you can imagine.
- **Dynamic Abilities Setup**: Define your own abilities and attributes for characters. Easily set up new abilities or modify existing ones to fit the needs of your specific LARP setting.
- **Automatic Calculations**: Larping handles all the heavy lifting by automatically calculating character statistics based on defined abilities, skills, items, and conditions. Say goodbye to manual math ‚Äì the system ensures real-time updates for character stats, ensuring accurate gameplay.

### 2. **Skills, Items, and Conditions Management**
- **Skill Creation**: Develop a vast array of skills with unique effects, costs, and prerequisites. Assign skills to characters and see their effects immediately reflected in their stats.
- **Item Integration**: Manage an extensive inventory of items, from weapons and armor to potions and magical artifacts. Each item can have its own unique effects, such as "+2 to Strength" or "-1 to Speed." 
- **Condition Handling**: Define and manage various conditions (like "Poisoned," "Enraged," or "Blessed") that can dynamically affect character abilities and stats. Apply these conditions directly to characters and let Larping automatically recalculate their abilities.

### 3. **Interactive Effects System**
- **Linked Effects**: Create complex game mechanics with effects tied to items, skills, or conditions. For example, an enchanted sword might grant a +2 bonus to attack rolls, while a "Cursed" condition might reduce a character's armor points by 1.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As characters acquire new items, learn skills, or experience in-game conditions, Larping will automatically adjust their stats and abilities, keeping your game balanced and flowing smoothly.

### 4. **Event and Background Management**
- **Background Approval Workflow**: Manage character backstories and ensure they align with your LARP's lore and rules. Review and approve character backgrounds before the game begins.
- **Event Subscription**: Handle event registrations, including waiting lists, and manage player participation. Larping makes it easy to track who‚Äôs attending which event and to assign XP or rewards based on participation.

### 5. **Experience and Leveling System**
- **Experience Tracking**: Automatically track XP earned through events, quests, or character achievements. Easily assign XP and let the system handle leveling up and ability enhancements.
- **Flexible Scoring System**: Customize experience gains, thresholds for leveling, and rewards to fit your game mechanics. Keep players engaged with a transparent and fair leveling system.
